## Astro 9: Final Project
**Due by Monday, August 14th at 6pm**

In order ot submit the final project, you will need to add and commit **all materials** to this repository.

At the very minimum, you should be submitting your lab-report **in pdf format** and a python script containing your code.
If you used a Jupyter Notebook for your final, that may contain both at the same time.
